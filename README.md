# Welcome To My Portfolio

My name is Joshua Kurniawan, I'm a Front-end Developer, whose mainly use React as my preferred language, but I also have experince in Angular as well.

The following project is just a compilation of design and template to showcase my profience in front-end programming.

The code is written using React with Next JS and Tailwind.

To run the project simply clone this project
```bash
git clone
```

Install the dependencies
```bash
npm i
# or
npm install
```

Then run the project
```bash
npm run dev
```

*Disclaimer
Some routes may not working perfectly as it is adjusted to work with the github page, notably from landing page to either shop or booking.
This can be fixed by simply add `/porto` right after the localhost or port url.

Thank you for checking in on this project
